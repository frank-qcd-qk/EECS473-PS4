# cxq41_ps4_irb120_heart

Code created by CXQ41@case.edu, the great and smart Frank Qian (Just kidding)...
Dependencies adopted from Dr. Neuman's 473 sample code...

## Example usage

If somehow you ended up here, you must be very bored or you are a student taking modern robot programming and you have no clue how to write the code. 

If you download the code and still can't figure out how to run it, go get some help from your TA or Dr. Newman.

## Running tests/demos

To run this "fun" code, you will also need irb120 dependencies. I have created a minimal dependency so that you don't need to download everything from learning ros, but just the specific for running this code demo. Dependencies can be found here: (Credit to Dr. Neuman)

If you have previously compiled irb120 code from learning ros before, it is highly recommended that you clean the build, devel and install folder so that there are no wired issue of package mis behavioring
